//Focus: The video focuses on understanding how React integrates with HTML.
//Key Points:
//Single Page Application: React primarily works with a single index.html file.
//DOM Manipulation: React uses the DOM to render components on the page.
//Virtual DOM: React creates its own internal representation of the DOM (virtual DOM) for efficient updates.
//Component Structure: React components are typically written in JavaScript files (e.g., MyComponent.js).
//Rendering: The render() method within a component defines what should be displayed on the screen.
